# When one prints 01,010,0100,01000 Python interprets this as binary.
# The results were 1, 8, 64, and 512 respectively.

# By manipulating the two example zip codes of 02492 and 02132 I found...
# that neither an 8 or a 9 can be present if these are to have valid syntax.
# Any combinations that are to contain an 8 or 9 can be input as a string.
